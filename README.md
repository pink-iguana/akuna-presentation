# Akuna Presentation: The LLL Algorithm and Its Applications

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and code examples for a presentation on the Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász (LLL) lattice basis reduction algorithm, its mathematical foundations, and its applications in number theory and finance.

## Contents

- **lattice_reduction_LLL.ipynb**  
  An interactive notebook introducing lattices, the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), the LLL algorithm, and its use in:
  - Lattice basis reduction
  - Integer relation detection (e.g., discovering algebraic relations)
  - The disproof of the Mertens conjecture

- **LLL_in_finance.ipynb**  
  A notebook exploring how LLL can be applied to portfolio construction and risk minimization in finance, including:
  - Construction of risk vectors for stocks
  - Use of LLL to find low-risk, low-cardinality portfolios
  - Comparison with a convex optimization approach
